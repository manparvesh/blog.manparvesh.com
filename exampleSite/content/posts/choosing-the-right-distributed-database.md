---

In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, selecting the appropriate distributed database is pivotal for building scalable and reliable applications. One of the most critical decisions revolves around balancing consistency, availability, performance, and cost. In this blog post, we explore the **consistency tradeoffs in distributed databases**, detailing how we navigated these challenges to select the optimal solution for our needs.

## Understanding Consistency in Distributed Databases

**Consistency** refers to the guarantee that every read receives the most recent write or an error. In distributed systems, achieving strong consistency can be challenging due to the inherent complexities of synchronizing data across multiple nodes. Balancing consistency with other factors like availability, latency, and cost is essential for building efficient and reliable applications.

### The CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem{{< sidenote >}}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem{{< /sidenote >}}, introduced by Eric Brewer, states that a distributed data store can only provide two out of the following three guarantees simultaneously:

1.	Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write.
2.	Availability: Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
3.	Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system.

Understanding this theorem is fundamental when evaluating distributed databases, as it highlights the tradeoffs that must be made based on application requirements.

## Our requirements
When selecting a distributed database for our application, we had clear priorities:

1.	Low Latency Writes and Reads: Our application demands rapid data access and updates to ensure a seamless user experience.
2.	Strong Consistency: We required guarantees that users always see the most up-to-date data.
3.	Managed Service by AWS: Leveraging AWS managed services would reduce operational overhead and ensure scalability and reliability.
4.	Cost-Effectiveness: While performance and consistency are paramount, keeping operational costs within budget is also crucial.

With these requirements in mind, we evaluated several AWS offerings to determine the best fit.

## Evaluating AWS Distributed Database Options

#### Pricing Details:

-	Provisioned Capacity Mode: Charged based on the number of read and write capacity units. As of the latest pricing:
    -	Write Capacity Unit (WCU): $0.00065 per WCU-hour.
    -	Read Capacity Unit (RCU): $0.00013 per RCU-hour.
-	On-Demand Capacity Mode: Pay-per-request pricing:
    -	Write Request Unit: $1.25 per million writes.
    -	Read Request Unit: $0.25 per million reads.
-	Additional Costs: Features like Global Tables, Streams, and backups incur extra charges.

### Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)

#### Advantages:

-	Low Latency: Redis is renowned for its lightning-fast read and write operations, ideal for applications requiring real-time data access.
-	Versatility: Supports various data structures, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.
-	Managed Service: ElastiCache handles maintenance, patching, and scaling.

#### Disadvantages:

-	Consistency Challenges: Redis, particularly when used in a distributed setup, can face challenges in maintaining strong consistency across nodes.
-	Persistence Limitations: While Redis supports persistence, it’s primarily an in-memory store, which might not be ideal for all use cases requiring durable storage.

#### Pricing Details:

-	Instance Pricing: Varies based on instance type and region. For example:
	-	Cache.t4g.small: Approximately $0.034 per hour.
	-	Cache.m6g.large: Approximately $0.154 per hour.
-	Additional Costs: Data transfer, backups, and replication may incur extra charges.

### Amazon MemoryDB for Redis

#### Advantages:

-	Strong Consistency: MemoryDB provides ACID transactions, ensuring strong consistency across distributed nodes.
-	Low Latency: Maintains Redis’s renowned speed for reads and writes.
-	Durability: Combines in-memory performance with multi-AZ replication and snapshot backups, ensuring data durability.
-	Managed Service: AWS handles the operational aspects, allowing us to focus on application development.

#### Disadvantages:

-	Cost: MemoryDB can be more expensive compared to other options like ElastiCache due to its enhanced features.
-	Newer Service: Being relatively newer, it may have fewer integrations and a smaller community compared to established services like ElastiCache and DynamoDB.
