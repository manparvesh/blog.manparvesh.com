description: A systematic approach to single-screen productivity using macOS virtual desktops and application segregation.
---

I transitioned from a three-monitor setup (laptop + dual 27" displays) to single-screen productivity to reduce context switching and eliminate notification distractions. The multi-screen configuration, while seemingly efficient, created cognitive overhead through constant peripheral interruptions.

## Implementation Strategy

### System Configuration

1. **Static Desktop Management:** Disable "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on recent use" in System Settings > Desktop & Dock
2. **Visual Dock Segmentation:** Install vertical-bar.app separators (9 instances) to create logical application groups
3. **Application Binding:** Assign each application to dedicated spaces via right-click context menu
4. **Animation Optimization:** Enable "Reduce motion" in Accessibility settings for faster transitions
5. **Keyboard Navigation:** Configure `Option + [1-9]` shortcuts for instant space switching via Mission Control settings

### Workflow Benefits

This configuration enforces single-tasking by design, eliminating visual distractions while maintaining rapid application access through muscle memory keyboard shortcuts. The systematic approach reduces decision fatigue and improves sustained focus on primary tasks.
